# Sentiment assessment
## Introduction
Social media is a priceless source of datasets which can be really interesting if used for bussiness purposes. In this project I am going to focus on Twitter/X. The goal is to analyze tweets to assess the sentiment about a topic. The output can be used for marketing, political campaings, Govermenet/oposition decisions, music industry, and many other scenarios.
Basically, I want to use tweets as a stream survey for (un)popular opinions. The user inputs a tag, the application retrieves tweets involving the tag, analyzes them and returns a report.

The stack to be used:
- Python 3.12
- PySpark for handling large datasets.
- Twitter API for fetching tweets in real time.
- Neural Networks and Random Forest, for classification.
- Flask, for displaying and reporting the results.

Along with the code processing, relevant information, warnings and erros are logged.
